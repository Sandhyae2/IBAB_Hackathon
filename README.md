## IBAB_Hackathon 🔍🧬
Participated in the ML for Protein Engineering hackathon organizedby IBAB in collaboration with Locksmith Bio.

Team Name: ALPHA_BENDERS
Team Mate: [S Varsha](https://github.com/VarshaS-37)

### Challenge 1
Re-designing of heavy-chain CDR loops (CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3) to create a novel antibody that has stability and improves binding affinity to PD-1 while demostrating significant novel sequence.

### Challenge 2 
Designa complete de novo VH/VL antiobodythat binds to PD-1.You may target the same epitope as pembrolizumab, a different epitope o design multi-epitope approaches.
